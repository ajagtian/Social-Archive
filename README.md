Social-Archive
==============

Adaptive Suggestion engine for social communities like Facebook and LinkedIn.



Social Networks like Facebook have a notion of events, which are attended by a lot many people.
However there has't ever been an Event Suggestion Engine provided by Facebook, and thus users have to search for 
keywords on Facebook time and time again to look for events they like to attend. Strangely though the choices and the search query of the events may remain same for over a short period of time. In such a case, a person may miss an event beacuse - he did remember to search it.

Social-Archive is an adaptive suggestion engine(presently) for Facebook Events/Groups/Pages.  Simple requirements of this application are - 
A user logs in through Facebook, sets his preferred event types, and preferred locations of the events, and that's it.

The application mines Facebook's Open Graph Api and brings a list of all the user's favorite events, ranked accoring to a likebility factor. So now a user may not have to search Facebook every couple of days for new events, instead all the events in the categories he wishes to attend will be listed to him. And then a user could RSVP event, add to his calendar, etc.
